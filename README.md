# Fluxapay

Fluxapay is a payment gateway on the Stellar blockchain that enables merchants to accept crypto payments and get settled in their local fiat currency.

FluxaPay bridges the gap between crypto payments and real-world commerce—making stablecoin payments as easy to integrate as Stripe.

## What Problem does Fluxapay solve?

Despite growing crypto adoption, everyday commerce remains largely fiat-based.

A major pain point is that crypto-native customers are forced to offramp every time they want to pay a merchant. This introduces:

•⁠  ⁠Extra fees from offramping and FX conversions  
•⁠  ⁠Payment delays and failed transactions  
•⁠  ⁠Poor checkout experience for crypto users  
•⁠  ⁠Lost sales for merchants  

At the same time, merchants want to accept crypto without holding volatile assets, managing wallets, or dealing with on-chain complexity.

Fluxapay solves this by enabling *USDC-in → fiat-out* payments with a merchant-friendly experience.

## How FluxaPay Works

1.⁠ ⁠*Merchant Creates a Charge*  
   Merchant creates a payment request via API or Payment Link.

2.⁠ ⁠*Customer Pays in USDC (Stellar)*  
   Customer pays from any supported Stellar wallet.

3.⁠ ⁠*Instant Verification*  
   FluxaPay verifies the payment on-chain and updates the payment status in real-time.

4.⁠ ⁠*Settlement to Merchant (Local Fiat)*  
   FluxaPay converts and settles the value to the merchant’s preferred local currency via bank transfer or supported payout channels.

##  Tech Stack (Planned)

•⁠  ⁠*Blockchain:* Stellar  
•⁠  ⁠*Stablecoin Rail:* USDC on Stellar  
•⁠  ⁠*Backend:* Node.js (TBD)  
•⁠  ⁠*Smart Contracts:* Stellar Soroban 
•⁠  ⁠*Database:* PostgreSQL  
•⁠  ⁠*APIs:* REST + Webhooks  
•⁠  ⁠*Frontend:* Next.js (Merchant Dashboard)  
•⁠  ⁠*FX & Settlement:* On-chain liquidity + payout partners  

## Use Cases

•⁠  ⁠E-commerce stores and marketplaces
•⁠  ⁠SaaS and subscription businesses

•⁠  ⁠Cross-border payments for global customers
•⁠  ⁠Merchants in emerging markets accepting stablecoin payments

## Vision

Make stablecoin payments simple, practical, and accessible so merchants can sell globally while customers pay directly with USDC, without offramping friction.
