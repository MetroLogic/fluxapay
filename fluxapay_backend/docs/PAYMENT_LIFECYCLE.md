# Payment Status Lifecycle

This document describes every `PaymentStatus` value, what triggers the
transition, and which downstream actions follow.

> Canonical enum is defined in `prisma/schema.prisma` and mirrored in
> `fluxapay_backend/src/types/payment.ts` (TypeScript) and
> `fluxapay_frontend/src/types/payment.ts` (frontend).

## States

| Status               | Description                                                                                           |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pending`            | Payment created; awaiting USDC deposit from the customer.                                             |
| `partially_paid`     | Cumulative deposits are below the required USDC amount; the remaining balance can be paid before expiry. |
| `confirmed`          | Full USDC amount received and verified on-chain. Settlement processing begins.                        |
| `overpaid`           | More USDC than required was received. Excess handling is per merchant configuration.                  |
| `expired`            | Payment window (15 min default) elapsed without sufficient funds received.                            |
| `failed`             | On-chain verification or settlement processing failed irrecoverably.                                  |
| `paid`               | Synonym for `confirmed` — used in some legacy API responses; maps to confirmed internally.            |
| `completed`          | Settlement has been disbursed to the merchant's bank account.                                         |
| `cancelled`          | Payment was cancelled (e.g. merchant account deleted, admin action).                                  |
| `refunded`           | Full refund has been processed and USDC returned to the payer.                                        |
| `partially_refunded` | A partial refund has been issued; some funds were returned to the payer.                              |

## Terminal States

A terminal state is one that cannot transition further:

- `expired`
- `failed`
- `paid` *(legacy)*
- `completed`
- `refunded`
- `partially_refunded`
- `cancelled`

Polling and SSE connections close once a terminal state is reached.
